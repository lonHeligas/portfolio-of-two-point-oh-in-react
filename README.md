# Portfolio of 2.0 (in React)

[This is the repository for this challenge](https://github.com/lonHeligas/portfolio-of-two-point-oh-in-react)


## Challenges I encountered

I should note that this app is currently incomplete, as the following things are missing:
ALL of the styling (it looks pretty ugly at the moment)
The Github and weblinks in the portfolio section
All of the portfolio pieces and the functionality for the cards
The text formatting and download function for the resume

I love working with React, but my head gets away from myself and I want to work on a dozen things at once. The fact that I'm not done with this yet (I will be by the end of the week and then I'll resubmit it) is evidence of that.

## Your Task

Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place not only to share your projects while you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share your work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

Your task is to create a portfolio using your new React skills, which will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies. 

You’ll deploy this application to GitHub Pages. Follow the instructions in the Git Guide or consult the [Create React App Docs on GitHub Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) to create a build that you can deploy.

**Important**: Be sure to push your codebase to the default branch in GitHub -- NOT your built and deployed code. Ensure this happens by using the `gh-pages` branch to host the deployed application's build.
